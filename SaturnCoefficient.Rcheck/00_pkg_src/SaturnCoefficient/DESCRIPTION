Description: A metric expressing the quality of a UMAP layout. This is a
    package that contains the Saturn_coefficient() function that reads an
    input matrix, its dimensionality reduction produced by UMAP, and
    evaluates the quality of this dimensionality reduction by producing a
    real value in the [0; 1] interval. We call this real value Saturn
    coefficient. A higher value means better dimensionality reduction; a
    lower value means worse dimensionality reduction.

    the quality of UMAP dimensionality reduction results" (2025, in preparation).
